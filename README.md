## About the Project
In today’s digital era, traditional tendering processes are time-consuming, inefficient, and prone to human errors. Manual submission and evaluation often cause delays and reduce transparency. The **Easy Tendering App** provides a secure, transparent, and efficient digital solution for the entire tendering process—from submission to evaluation—through a mobile and web-based platform.


### Objectives
- Develop a mobile platform where organizations can publish tenders and bidders can submit proposals electronically.
- Automate document verification, bid evaluation, and notification systems.
- Ensure security and transparency using encryption, digital signatures, and audit logs.
- Design a user-friendly interface for both admins and bidders with role-based access.
- Provide real-time notifications for deadlines, updates, and results.

### Target Users
- **Organizations** (Government and Private) – publish tenders.
- **Registered bidders/companies** – submit proposals online.
- **Tender evaluators/administrators** – review and award bids.
